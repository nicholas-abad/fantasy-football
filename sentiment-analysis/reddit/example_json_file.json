            "People forget that Hunt had a 65% snap share in 2017 with the Chiefs and he led the league in rushing that year. CEH will likely not perform to that exact same level but he is being used in an almost identical way and will be plenty good for fantasy.",
            "About as good as I could have hoped for. A solid 19.8 in .5 PPR, looks electric. 25 carries, goal line work, 65% of snaps his first ever NFL game with zero preseason...and the chiefs are still the best offense in the league. \n\nPretty pumped",
            "As a Chiefs fan, wonderful game last night. As a CEH owner, I was crying every time he ran into a brick wall at the goal line. The tease was too much.",
            "The issue with the goal line carries were (1) they were uninspired play calls on purpose, there's no need to get fancy with the game secured. If he scored, great. If he didn't, the clock ran. and (2) JJ Watt and the Texans became a completely different defensive front on the goalline selling out against the run every time. Creative play calling would have gotten someone in.",
            "CEH was always going to succeed in this KC offense. Its not like CEH is playing for the Jags. Its almost unfair now that CEH makes the Chiefs offense and all their fantasy players BETTER.",
            "He looked really good last night. Able to shed tackles, quick shifty movement and solid speed to break away with. He also looked patient to make sure his blockers created a lane for him. I definitely don't think it was a fluke",
            "Currently RB1 on the season. Take that CMC.",

            "I don\u2019t blame it on him for those Goal line stands. Houston D was in the backfield as soon as he took the handoff. No one was getting on those plays. Either way very encouraging to see him get those carries when most people were saying he wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m excited and glad I took a shot on him this year."
