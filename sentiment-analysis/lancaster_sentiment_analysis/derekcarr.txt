@ror____________ @VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr When he has someone to throw to, he is MVP caliber.  He's going to prove the haters wrong this season.  Plus, he wont have a bottom-tier defense screwing the team every game this year if people stay healthy.
@VinnyBonsignore @Oklandraida84 @Raiders @derekcarr Just wait till the season start and watch if Derek can lead
@DaveT94939741 @VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr He‚Äôs a late bloomer...like Rich Gannon üòÅ
@Murf_Five @VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr That's what happens when you're learning a new system every offseason, along with all new WR's. He's going into his 3rd season in the system, for the 1st time ever. I mean, most of the WR's are new again, but at least this time they have potential to be legit.
@DaveT94939741 @VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr Well, when you have 4 different OC's in 5 seasons, and 20+ different outside WR's in that time, it can kind of slow the process.

@ror____________ @chelopez1 @VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr Weren‚Äôt there 9 dropped passes in the Jets game?
@mcdtreb @VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr @derekcarrqb 1. 100% will be the first in line to eat crow if Derek plays like pre-2016 injury Derek again.  2. If he doesn't, I honestly don't care if fans admit they were wrong or not. I just want to get us a QB who can show up consistently on gamedays and get us some fucking wins.
@mikereppucci @chelopez1 @VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr Go watch every offensive snap from the Jets game onwards last season, then come back to me on the whole "wasn't Carr's fault" thing... he was pure garbage in the 2nd half of last season. Can't say it any other way.
@ror____________ @VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr I just hope everyone who has talked shit every yr on @derekcarrqb will admit how wrong they are/were. All he's done is get better every yr. Last yr was arguably his best season statistically with  4th and 5th string receivers (not counting Hunter &amp; Tyrell ) Weapons galore üëç
@chelopez1 @ror____________ @VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr Came close last year too, and it wasn't Carr's fault. Defense stops the last drive of the Texans and Jags they make it.
@VinnyBonsignore @Raiders @derekcarr Practice warrior and champion leta wait and see if he can translate that on games
Been saying this for years. Carr is the least of the Raiders problems. Give him a top 15 defense and he‚Äôs in the playoffs every year. #raiders #DerekCarr #nfl #raidernation https://t.co/6N174FVC4V

Nov/Dec: Carr can‚Äôt keep offense on field for more than 3 plays, 70% completion rate to dump offs to covered receivers behind LOS... padded stats in 4th q of a blowout loss ü§ô
