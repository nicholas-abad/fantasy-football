# Idea
1. Perform sentiment analysis during the off-season and pre-season to see how a player is performing before the draft occurs
2. Use historical data to generate a prediction of how these players will perform this season
3. Plug these outputs into a neural network for a final prediction
  - First, I want to predict average draft rankings but this is quite subjective
  - Two, I want to predict what their draft auction value will be.
